This will download and run the install script which installs all dependancies and sets everything up the way it should.

`-b` Will let you customize the Browser tab title in case you want that. (Default is DashLinx)

`-p` Will let you set the port that the server will listen on. (Default is 80) Note: 443 may not work as expected as there is currently no self-signed cert issued to the server

`-P` Will let you specify a set password for the database that is created (Default is a randomly generated string)
